# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# User.create!(name: "管理者",
#              email: "admin@admin.com",
#              password: "111111",
#              password_confirmation: "111111",
#              admin: true)
# 10.times do |n|
#   email = Faker::Internet.email
#   password = "password"
